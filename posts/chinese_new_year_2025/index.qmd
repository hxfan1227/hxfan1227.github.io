This year, the festivities begin on Wednesday, Jan. 29, 2025, marking the arrival of the Year of the Snake 🐍, according to the Chinese zodiac. 
The Chinese zodiac follows a 12-year cycle, with each year associated with a specific animal. 
The 12 animals in this cycle are: *Rat* 🐀, *Ox* 🐂, *Tiger* 🐅, *Rabbit* 🐇, *Dragon* 🐉, *Snake* 🐍, *Horse* 🐎, *Goat* 🐐, *Monkey* 🐒, *Rooster* 🐓, *Dog* 🐕, and *Pig* 🐖.
The Snake 🐍 is the sixth animal in the cycle, following the Dragon 🐉, which is considered the most auspicious of all zodiac signs. Because of this, the Year of the Snake is sometimes referred to as the "Little Dragon Year."
