## RESEARCH EXPERIENCE

### Honorary visiting scholar

***Flinders University, South Australia*** [Jan 2024 -- Present]{.cvdate}

Work with Prof. [Adrian Werner](https://www.flinders.edu.au/people/adrian.werner) on surface-groundwater interaction related projects.

- Focus on coastal hydrology and surface-groundwater interactions.
- Submarine Freshwater Groundwater Discharge (SFGD). 

### Research assistant 

***Nanjing Institute of Geography and Limnology, Chinese Academy of Sciences*** [Jul 2019 -- Present]{.cvdate}

- Built a fully coupled model for surface-groundwater interaction in floodplain wetlands.
- Developed a new algorithm for evaluating surface hydrological connectivity with parallel computing technique.
- Explored how convective behaviors and moisture sources determine the variability of precipitation stable isotope
- Developed a random forest model to predict river isotopes across China at the catchment scale.

### Ph.D. Candidate

***University of Chinese Academy of Science*** [Sep 2016 -- Jul 2019]{.cvdate}

- Built a 2D water environment model for Poyang Lake in China and coupled it with a runoff prediction model.
- Attributed the relative contributions of climate change and anthropogenic activities on the water environment.
